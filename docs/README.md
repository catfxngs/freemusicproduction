## What Is This?

Music production can easily become a very expensive form of artistic expression. The purpose of this guide is to eliminate any financial-based obstacles for aspiring musicians, by providing an in-depth resource with alternative methods. Creativity and self-expression should have *no* limits.

This guide contains **free community resources**, explanations of **torrenting** (for software), and more. You are encouraged to directly support individual artists, however, big corporations will *not* be the obstacle in your path to creating art. It is ***always*** recommended to purchase software when you are eventually in a comfortable situation financially.

## Understanding Legality

**Piracy is illegal under any circumstance.** 

By choosing to torrent software you do not own the rights to, you acknowledge the risks of owning illegally obtained software. While generally, the risk of repercussions is almost unheard of, you are *still* putting yourself at risk of legal trouble. Do not be stupid, **use a VPN**, and *turn off seeding* for copyrighted content.

Following this resource carefully will virtually guarantee your safety - but you need to be smart.

## Getting Started

The software included in this resource is focused on Windows. Alternatives for other platforms will be listed when possible, but do *not* have proper documentation.
