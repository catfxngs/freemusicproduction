# Piracy

> This page is under development as of 9/20/2022.

While illegal piracy is not condoned, and no direct downloads to copyrighted material will ever be provided here, resources to guide you and instructions on staying safe *will*. If you're going to torrent, it's important you stay safe and know exactly what to look for.

Never download "cracked software" or .exe files off the internet from an untrustworthy source.

In the meantime, [**r/Piracy**](https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy) is a great resource for staying safe while pirating. [**This megathread**](https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/wiki/megathread/) can help point you in the right direction. It is, however, no longer maintained - so use at your own risk.

[**uBlock Origin**](https://ublockorigin.com/) is a *necessity* for visiting any websites that provide torrents. Keep your AdBlocker **on at all times**.

Further documentation will be provided in the next update, elaborating on VPNs and focusing on resources for music production, including:
- **DAWs** (Digital Audio Workstations)
- **VST Plugins**
- and more...

With a basic understanding of torrenting, you should already be well on your way! :)

Please be patient while I work on the next update.

**Thank you** for your continued support on this project. The overall goal here is to give all musicians the freedom to express themselves creatively under any circumstance. I am looking forward to highlighting all the amazing communities and musicians with their own resources for upcoming musicians, too!

If you would like to contribute to the documentation, have any questions, or just want to say thanks, please reach out to me via [email](mailto:luna@fangs.cat) or Discord (fangs#9999).

Much love, and take care!
